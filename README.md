# universityFinder
For accessing the Web application, we need to follow these steps:
1. Open command prompt and change the directory to the one where the project
folder is in your system.
2. When we are in the project folder, write "node app.js" in command line
(expecting you have Node.JS installed. If not then follow
https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install).
3. After the previous step, you will see "Server is running on port 3000" on the
console.
4. Open any web browser on the system and write "localhost:3000".
5. The University Locator App will load up.
